can do ./gradlew assemble
before ./gradle build..  i think

where I have to manually do the gradle build, need a python script that starts running after
custom build stuff is set up.



the order that the scripts need to go in:

remove the repo that was just tested on..? or maybe i can delete them manually.. who knows
cache clean
then clone
then sort out properties
then first compile
then modify the build script
then second compile

need a script that ties these all into stages and records errors at each stage
